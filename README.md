# My Android Development Learning Journey 📱

Welcome to my Android development repository! This is where I document my learning progress and experiments with Android app development using Kotlin. 

## About This Repository 🎯

This is my personal learning space where I explore different Android concepts, try out new features, and grow as a developer. Each project represents a different stage in my learning journey:

- `1first/` - My first steps into Android development
- `2second/` - Exploring UI and basic interactions
- `3third/` - Working with complex UI features
- `4fourth/` - Login with textfields, button and Toast

Feel free to explore these projects and learn along with me!
